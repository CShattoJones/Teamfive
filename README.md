## Project Description and Outline
An important factor in population growth is the total fertility rate. Tracking fertility rates can allow for more beneficial planning and resource allocation in a particular region.
Explore and analyze the age specific fertility rates, total fertility and mean age at childbearing. Determine where are there changes in infant mortality rates and see how that compares to the age of the mother.


## Research Questions to Answer
1. Do literacy rates effect fertility rates by age?
2. Comparison of infant mortality rates in the USA to other countries?
3. What is the ranking of factors that affect fertility?
4. Where are fertility rates increasing and decreasing
5. How has the age of childbearing changed over time?


## Data Sets to be Used
World Fertility Data
http://data.un.org/DocumentData.aspx?id=319

Literacy Rates by Country

Mortality Rate, infant per 1,000 live births

Notes:
The total fertility rate can be calculated using age-specific birth rates. An age-specific birth rate is the number of babies born within a 5-year increment during reproductive years. The TFR is the calculation of adding up all the age-specific birth rates for a population and multiplying by five.

## Task Breakdown
1. Complete datasets needed 
2. create raw datasets and clean as needed - document changes
3. exploration of data to determine needs to answer questions
4. create plotting of data
5. create analysis of data
6. discuss findings and answer questions
7. create presentation
