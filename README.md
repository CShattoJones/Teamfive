## Project Description and Outline
An important factor in population growth is the total fertility rate. Tracking fertility rates can allow for more beneficial planning and resource allocation in a particular region.
Explore and analyze the age specific fertility rates, total fertility and mean age at childbearing. Determine where are there changes in infant mortality rates and see how that compares to the age of the mother and other factors specifically how literacy effects fertility rates.


## Research Questions to Answer
1. Do literacy rates effect fertility rates by age?
2. What is the ranking of factors that affect fertility?
3. Where are fertility rates increasing and decreasing in comparison to literacy rates?
4. How has the age of childbearing changed over time?


## Data Sets to be Used
World Fertility Data
http://data.un.org/DocumentData.aspx?id=319

Literacy Rates by Country

Mortality Rate, infant per 1,000 live births
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN

Notes:
The total fertility rate can be calculated using age-specific birth rates. An age-specific birth rate is the number of babies born within a 5-year increment during reproductive years. The TFR is the calculation of adding up all the age-specific birth rates for a population and multiplying by five.

## Task Breakdown
1. Finding Data - review the listed sources and determine if viable for project. Modify as needed.
2. create raw datasets and clean as needed - document changes
3. exploration of data to determine needs to answer questions - reformat as needed
4. Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process
5. Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis
6. Using Matplotlib to create visualizations of data
7. Create a write-up summarizing our findings. Headings for each question - add this to final readme file
8. Create PNG images of visualizations for distribution at presentation
